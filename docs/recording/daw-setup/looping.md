**Looping a recorded track in Studio One 5**

To loop, you can select the whole recorded track or a selection of it â€“ to do that hover over the track and click + drag the selection

Your loop may need some cropping. To see the track better go to View and choose Editor or hit F2

A strip will pop up. I usually cut the end trails and sometimes the beginning. To do that, simply point and drag the cursor on the part you want to remove, right click and choose Delete
